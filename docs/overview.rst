Overview

As explained in the `Theoretical Background <https://gee-assessment-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/background.html>`_, areas of map categories should not be obtained by counting pixels in maps because of classification errors. Instead, a sample of reference observations need to be collected to which an unbiased estimator is applied to obtain an area estimate with confidence intervals. The tools provided here lend support for each step the estimation workflow.

The first step is selecting the sample locations where you will need to observe reference conditions. Support for several sampling designs are provided. If land change is of interest, which tend to be a small part of the study area, `stratified sampling <https://gee-assessment-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/str_sample.html>`_ is recommended with the categories of change map used to define strata. `Simple random <https://gee-assessment-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/srs_sample.html>`_ sampling is also supported, as are `stratified <https://gee-assessment-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sys_sample.html>`_ and `simple systematic <https://gee-assessment-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sys_str_sample.html>`_ sampling. 

The big benefit of Google Earth Engine is that the data needed to observe the reference conditions on the land surface are available without having to download the data. A couple of different applications are available to users to collect the reference observations: `Timeseries Viewer <https://gee-assessment-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tsviewer.html>`_ is Google Earth Engine application that extracts time series of all available Landsat and Sentinel-2 observations for reconstruction of changes on the land surface. `Collect Earth <https://gee-assessment-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/colearth.html>`_ is part of UN-FAO's OpenForis initiative and provides access to high resolution data in Google Earth and Bing Maps. `TimeSync <https://gee-assessment-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/timesync.html>`_ is similar to the Timeseries Viewer and provide access to time series of Landsat data.

Once the sample data have been collected, an estimator that corresponds to the sampling design provide an estimate or area or accuracy with confidence intervals when applied to the sample data. Support for application of various estimators are provided in addition to guidance for choosing an appropriate estimator.
