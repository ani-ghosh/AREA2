Stratified Estimator |cir|
==========================

To use the stratified estimator for estimation of map accuracy and the area of map categories, make sure that you have in place a sample and a map to define strata. The sample should have been collected by stratified sampling and a reference observations should exist for each sample unit. In case the sample data was collected by simple random and simple systematic sampling, use the `post-stratified estimator <https://gee-assessment-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/estimator_post_str.html>`_.

1. Start by opening the Google Earth Engine AA Estimation Toolbox
