Stratified Estimation |cir|
===========================

An example is provided here to illustrate the estimation of the area of forest loss for the country of Cambodia between 2000 and 2010 using stratified estimation. The example has three different parts: 1) sampling design -- a sample is selected by stratified random sampling; 2) response design which involves observing the reference conditions at sample unit in  various satellite data available in Google Earth Engine; and 3) the analysis which is based on the application of a stratified estimator to the sample data.

Note that all data are made-up and do not reflect actual conditions in Cambodia! 

1. Sampling Design
------------------

Because the area of forest loss is small relative the total study area, using non-stratified designs would require a very large sample size to ensure a sufficient number of observations of forest loss in the sample data. To use a stratified design, we will first need to define a stratification. In this case we will use the
