Choosing an estimator
=====================

We provide support for four different estimators. Consider the following when choosing between estimators:

- **Stratified estimator**. The stratified estimator is recommended for estimating population parameters from sample data obtained by stratified random sampling. The estimator is expressed as the sum of the means of the simple random samples within strata weighted by stratum weights calculated as relative proportions of the population within strata.

- **Post-stratified estimator**. We recommend the use of a post-stratified estimator when sample data has been collected by *simple random* or *simple systematic* designs, and when a stratification has been applied to the study area subsequent to the sampling. Consider the following example: if a systematic sample of field plots has been collected for estimation of forest area, post-stratifying the study area by a forest/non-forest map and using a post-stratified estimator is likely to increase precision in area estimates compared to just simply applying a simple random estimator (i.e. the mean value). Note that the post-stratified estimator is a stratified estimator applied to sample data collected to simple random/systematic designs.
